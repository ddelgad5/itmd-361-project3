      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is David Delgado.  I am a third year student at Illinois Tech, but only
        three semesters into the Information Technology and Management (ITM) program.
        Originally, I was majoring in electrical engineering, but the math is not for
        the feint of heart.  I am specializing in systems administration and minoring in
        computer science.  I am a commuter student and it takes about an hour twenty to
        get from Jefferson Park to Bronzeville via the CTA. Although, it's really
        difficult to get involved in the organizations here, I run a radio show here on
        campus. You can find out more about my show on my <a href="music/">music</a>
        page!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a native of Chicago and I have this unexplainable love for the
        city.  For a majority of my life, I've resided in the 60630 area.
        My most favorite hobby to do in the city is biking.  There's this
        inexplicable rush you get when your dodging cars on the Mag Mile,
        dodging people on the Chicago Lakefront Trail, or just taking in the
        view of the forest on the North Branch Trail (technically this is
        Chicagoland).
